The AutoIt library (/AutoItX3.dll/) is not thread safe. However
because we use this library with /node-ffi/ we do not have control
over which thread is used to call into the library in Zipper
Desktop. This is a drop-in replacement for /AutoItX3.dll/ which wraps
the original library in such a way that it can be called in a
multi-threaded manner.

** Dependencies
   In order to build this library /GNU Make/ and /mingw-w64/ for i686
   are required.

** Building
   Run ~make~.

** Usage
   The generated /AutoItX3.dll/ expects to find the
   /AutoItX3_original.dll/ library at runtime, which is just the
   original /AutoItX3.dll/, renamed. The generated library fulfills
   the same interface as that of the one it wraps.
